<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my portfolio!<br/> 
  This website showcases my journey and projects as part of The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp.<br/>
  I am a second-year Computer Science student at DeMontfort University in Leicester, England.<br/>
  In a world driven by technology, I am passionate about creating innovative, 
  user-friendly solutions by mastering both front-end and back-end development.</p>

<p>Beyond my work in web development, 
  I love exploring the world—both physically and intellectually. <br/>
  I’ve been fortunate to hike to Mount Everest Base Camp, complete the Mont Blanc Circuit, 
  and immerse myself in the jungles of Guatemala. <br/>
  These adventures have shaped my resilience and creative problem-solving abilities.</p>

<p>I am also a proud vegan of over 14 years, living a lifestyle that reflects my commitment to sustainability and compassion.</p>
